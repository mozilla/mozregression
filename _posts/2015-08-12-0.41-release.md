mozregression 0.41 fixes [bug 1185756], which caused the following
warning on Windows:

    WindowsError: [Error 32] The process cannot access the file
    because it is being used by another process

Also, mozregression is now more tolerant when facing failures like
a build not installable or a crash from the tested application
(see [bug 1192485]).

And finally, when using mozregression with a custom profile
it won't be modified anymore (see [bug 999009]). This was a
longstanding bug - thanks to Jonathan Pigree for his help in fixing it!
