title:  "GUI release 0.4.0"
author: Julien Pag√®s

Sorry for the delay on GUI release and posts, but we were quite busy
with mozregression command line these days!

Still we don't forget about the GUI. And now there are a bunch of great
new cool things with this 0.4.0 release!

- quite a lot of bugfixes, I won't enumerate them; :)
- this is now possible to choose the next build to be tested after
  a skip, thus allowing to be in the good-bad range again faster
  ([bug 1203852])
- automatic check if new releases are available and inform the user
  ([bug 1177001])
- we added a crash report dialog, that will show up on crashes, so you
  will be able to help us fix the bug by reporting the internal error shown.
  I hope you won't see this often though! ([bug 1202242])

As usual now, big thanks for MikeLing and Jonathan Pigree for their work
and time! They both have a really great impact on the software, from
decisions to implementations.
