title:  "Release 2.0.0"
author: Julien Pag√®s

2.0.0 is a major release of mozregression, as we changed the bisection flow
based on ideas in the [post I wrote a couple of weeks ago].

Now mozregression will automatically detect a merge commit, and switch to bisect
in the branch where the merged commits comes from. So *mozilla-inbound* is no
longer the default for Firefox when bisecting by date is done, since there is no
default now.

Based on that, we have been able to simplify the overall usage of mozregression:

* removed the **-\-inbound-branch** option. Just use **-\-repo** now when you
  want to specify a branch, no matter if it is an integration or a release
  branch.

* allowed to bisect using dates on an integration branch

* removed the **-\-good-rev**, **-\-bad-rev**, **-\-good-release** and
  **-\-bad-release options**. Just use **-\-good** and **-\-bad** for everything
  now, being a date, a changeset, a release number or a build id.

* added some aliases for the branch names: you can use *m-i*, *inbound* or
  *mozilla-inbound* to describe the same branch - another example, *m-c*,
  *central* and *mozilla-central* are equivalent.

* mozregression is smarter to let you test builds with a specific flavor, e.g.
  *debug* builds.

Those changes adds some new possibilities to bisect which were not available
before, like bisecting using changesets on mozilla-central, only specify
a good changeset (the bad changeset will be implied, and will be the most
recent one).

Some examples:

{% highlight bash %}
# bisect using dates
mozregression -g 2015-11-20 -b 2015-11-25  # implied branch is m-c
mozregression -g 2015-11-20 -b 2015-11-25 --repo inbound
# bisect using changesets
mozregression -g dcd5230c4ce1 -b 931721112d8e  # implied branch is m-i
mozregression -g 1b2e15608f34 -b abbd213422a5 --repo m-c
# use debug builds
mozregression -g 2015-11-20 -b 2015-11-25 -B debug
mozregression -g dcd5230c4ce1 -b 931721112d8e -B debug
# of course, --launch works the same way now
mozregression --launch abbd213422a5 --repo m-c
mozregression --launch 2015-11-25 --repo m-i -B debug
{% endhighlight %}

Just keep in mind that when you use a changeset, the default branch will be the
default integration branch for the application instead of the release branch.
For firefox, *mozilla-inbound* will be the default when you use a changeset,
and *mozilla-central* will be used otherwise. This is historical and
we may change that in the future - for now just keep that in mind, or
*always specify a branch to be sure*.
