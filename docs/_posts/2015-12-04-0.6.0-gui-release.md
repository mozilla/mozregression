title:  "GUI Release 0.6.0"

After mozregression 2.0, it is time for the GUI to follow!

0.6.0 GUI release is based on the changes from mozregression 2.0: the bisection
flow is now updated, and starting a bisection should be a lot *easier* since it
does not ask anymore for a nightly or inbound bisection kind - simply choose
an application, possibly a branch and some options (build type, bits) then
choose the regression range based on dates, release numbers, build ids or
raw changesets.

That's all. :)

All in all, a great simplification of the interface and more power. Give it
a try!
