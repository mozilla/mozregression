# Install or upgrade

## mozregression-gui

For the graphical interface, we provide a simple installation process:

- **Windows**:
  Download the latest **mozregression-gui.exe** file from the
  [github releases]. Once the file is downloaded double-click on it and
  follow the installation process.

- **Linux 64**:
  We provide a frozen application (that includes python itself) in the
  [github releases]. You can try it out by downloading the
  **mozregression-gui.tar.gz**, decompress it somewhere and run the
  mozregression-gui executable file.

Please note that the mozregression GUI (including the installation process)
is at a very early stage of development -- please report any bug you find.

A graphical installation process for MacOS X is planned. You can still install
the GUI directly [from github] if your OS is not supported or if you have issues
with the prebuilt packages.


## mozregression

The original command line tool.

mozregression is a Python (currently 2.7) package installable via pip. You can
follow the OS-specific instructions to install pip if you don't know how to do it:

- **Windows**

  Download and install python 2.7 from
  [ActiveState](http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads).
  It will include pip and set python in your PATH.
- **Mac**

      sudo easy_install pip

- **Ubuntu**

      sudo apt-get install python-pip

- **Other linuxes**

  *Beware! Some distributions use Python 3 by default. In this case you need to install python2-pip.*

  Example for archlinux:

      sudo pacman -S python2-pip

Once you have pip installed along with python 2.7, just open a terminal
(or a windows shell) and execute the following depending on what platform
you are on:

- **Windows**

      pip install -U mozregression

- **Linux / Mac**

      sudo pip2 install -U mozregression
