    ApproxPersistChooser is able to pick a persistent file that is *near*
    the one we should download.

    For example, if you pass 7 for the *one_every* parameter, it will search
    for builds around the one we need in this way:

    0 if len(bisection range) is < 7
    1 if len(bisection range) is >= 7 and < 14
    2 if len(bisection range) is >= 14 and < 21

    So if the desired nightly build is 2015-07-10 and the bisection range is
    2015-07-05 - 2015-07-15, this will try to locate a persitent file from
